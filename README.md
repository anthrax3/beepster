# beepster

This is my final project for Parallel and Distributed computing.

It plays music using multiple networked computers and their motherboard
speakers. My first (and hopefully only attempt) at this will be in golang.

# Resources
- [Original beep program](https://github.com/johnath/beep/blob/master/beep.c)
- [ioctl implementation in go](https://github.com/edsrzf/fineline/blob/master/ioctl.go)

# TODO
- [X] Play a beep with go
- [ ] Play different pitched beeps
- [ ] Create a Conductor server
- [ ] Create a Player client
